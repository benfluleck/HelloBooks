## Getting Started
This is a javascript application built with [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) framework on the nodejs platform. Authentication of users is done via [**JSON Web Tokens**](https://jwt.io/).


## Technology Stack
**UI & Templates**
1. HTML & CSS
2. Materialize CSS Framework
3. Javascript
4. JQuery

**Server Side**
1. NodeJS
2. Express
3. Sequelize

**Client Side**
1. React(Redux)

### Dependencies
* Postgres
* Node


## Installation

1. Install [**Node JS**](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install [**Postgres**](https://www.postgresql.org/) .
3. Clone the [**repository here**](https://github.com/benfluleck/HelloBooks.git)
4. [**cd**] into the root of the **project directory**.
5. Run `npm install` on the terminal to install Dependecies
6. Install sequelize-cli, Create Postgresql database, Navigate to server directory and run migrations:
```
npm install -g seqeulize-cli
cd server
sequelize db:migrate
```
7. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the application. Use a different database for your testing and development. Example of the content of a .env file is shown in the .env.sample

8. Start the application:
**_Different Build Environment_**

**Production**
```
npm run start-prod
```
**Development**
```
npm run start:dev
npm run build:dev
```

## Usage
- Run database migration with `npm start:migrate`
- Start app development with `npm run start` or `npm start`
- To start the client `npm run start:webdev`
- Install **Postman** and use to test all endpoints

## Limitations
The limitations with this current version of Hello Books includes:
- Authenticated Users can not read books

## Testing

Sever side tests - Run `npm test` on the terminal while within the **project root directory**.
Client side tests - Run `npm client:test` on the terminal while within the **project root directory**.

Server side testing is achieved through use of `chai-http`, `mocha` and `chai` packages. `chai-http` is used to make requests to the api and `mocha` is the testing framework and `chai` is the exception library. They will both be installed when you run `npm install` and the tests will run when you run `npm test`.

Client side testing is achieved through the use of `jest` package. `jest` is used to test javascript code in
React applications.
